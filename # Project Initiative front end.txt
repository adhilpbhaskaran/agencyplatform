# Project Initiative: The Premium Marketing & Onboarding Experience

**Objective:** To build a complete, visually attractive, and persuasive public-facing website and a seamless new-user onboarding flow. The goal is to attract high-quality travel agents and provide them with an exceptional "first five minutes" experience that demonstrates the platform's value instantly.

### **Part 1: The Core Design Language (Aesthetic & Feel)**

Before building any pages, implement this design system to ensure a consistent, premium feel across the entire site.

* **Theme:** Dark Mode First. The entire public site and the application dashboard should use a professional dark theme.
* **Color Palette:**
    * **Primary Background:** A deep charcoal/off-black (e.g., `#111827`).
    * **Secondary Background / Cards:** A slightly lighter slate gray (e.g., `#1F2937`).
    * **Accent Color:** The existing "Bali Malayali" vibrant blue-to-green gradient for all primary buttons, links, and highlights.
    * **Primary Text:** An off-white or very light gray for readability (e.g., `#E5E7EB`).
    * **Muted Text:** A softer gray for sub-headlines and descriptive text (e.g., `#9CA3AF`).
* **Typography:**
    * **Headings:** Use a clean, modern, sans-serif font like **Inter** or **Manrope**. Headings should be bold and well-spaced.
    * **Body Text:** Use the same font but in a regular weight for maximum readability.
* **Imagery:**
    * All photography must be of the highest quality. Use sources like Unsplash or Pexels.
    * **Theme:** Focus on images that evoke luxury, serenity, professionalism, and the unique beauty of Bali (e.g., infinity pools, clean hotel rooms, majestic temples, lush rice terraces).

### **Part 2: The Public Marketing Website (The "Front Door")**

This section details every page a potential customer will interact with before signing up.

#### **1. Home Page (`/`)**

This is our most important marketing asset. It must be structured to tell a compelling story.

* **Navbar:**
    * Logo on the left.
    * Links: `Features`, `Why Us`, `Pricing`, `About Bali`, `Blog`.
    * Right side: "Sign In" button (secondary style) and "Get Started" button (primary accent color).

    * **Headline:** `Everything you need to grow your travel business`
    * **Sub-headline:** `From quote generation to payment processing, we've got you covered.`
    * Use a grid of 6 feature cards with icons:
        1.  **Smart Quote Generator:** Create detailed, multi-option quotes in minutes.
        2.  **Real-time Pricing Engine:** Dynamic pricing with live FX rates protects your margins.

    * **"The Bali Malayali Way" (Right Column):** Use actual, high-quality screenshots of the platform's UI to solve each pain point: a screenshot of the `Quote Editor`, the `Generated PDF`, the `Payment Dashboard`, and the `Affiliate Wallet`.

#### **3. "Partner With Us" Page (`/partner-with-us`)**

### **Part 3: The Content Sprint (Footer Pages)**

Create a new page for every link in the footer. Each page must have the standard site header and footer and use the dark theme.

* **Platform Section:**
    * `/features`: A detailed page listing all platform features with short descriptions.
    * `/pricing`: Create a simple 3-tier pricing table (e.g., **Freelancer** - Free, **Agency** - $49/mo, **Enterprise** - Custom) with a list of features included in each tier.
    * `/api`: "Developer API Coming Soon. We plan to release a robust API for programmatic access to our platform in Q4 2025."
    * `/documentation`: "Our comprehensive documentation and knowledge base is currently in development."

    * `/blog`: Create a simple blog index page with 2-3 placeholder posts with titles, summaries, and "Read More" links. (e.g., "Top 5 Luxury Villas in Ubud for 2026," "How to Sell Experiential Travel in Bali").
    * `/careers`: "Work With Us: We are a passionate team dedicated to revolutionizing the travel industry. We're always looking for talented individuals. Currently, we have openings for: Senior Full-Stack Engineer, Customer Success Manager."
    * `/privacy`: A page with standard, boilerplate privacy policy text.

### **Part 4: The "First Five Minutes" Onboarding Experience**

This covers the "Empty State" dashboard for a newly registered user.

* **Directive:** When an agent logs in for the first time (`quotes.length === 0`), the standard dashboard must be replaced with a dedicated onboarding component.
* **Implementation:**
    * A large, centered welcome card should be displayed.
    * The card must contain:
        * **Personalized Greeting:** `<h2>Welcome, [Agent's Name]! Let's create your first Bali masterpiece.</h2>`
        * **Primary Call-to-Action:** A large, primary-colored button: `[+ Create Your First Quote]`
        * **Onboarding Checklist:** A small, interactive checklist to guide them:
            * `[ ] Complete Your Profile (link to /settings)`
            * `[ ] Upload Your Agency Logo (link to /settings)`
            * `[ ] Create Your First Quote`
* **Pro-Tier Enhancement (Optional):** Implement a one-time guided tour using a library like `Shepherd.js` that triggers on the first login.
